# Model Predictive Control project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

The purpose of this project is to develop a Model Predictive Controller to drive a car in the Udacity simulator. Given a model of the car and a desired trajectory, the controller is able to generate the sequence of optimal actuator commands for the finite time horizon, within the discritization tolerance. The first command in this sequence is sent to the actuators, then the process is repeated from the updated state.

For this project, a kinematic model of a car called a 'bicycle model' was used. In this model, both the front and rear axles are approximated as a single wheel, like a bicycle. The actuators used were the steering angle `delta` and longitudinal acceleration `a`. The trajectory was provided to the controller as a 3rd order polynomial f(x). The trajectory tracking errors used were 'cross track error' `cte`, and heading error `e_psi`. The following equations were used to model the system:

`x[t+1] = x[t] + v[t]*cos(psi[t])*dt`

`y[t+1] = y[t] + v[t]*sin(psi[t])*dt`

`psi[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t]/Lf * delta[t] * dt`

`v[t+1] = v[t] + a[t]*dt`

`cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t]*sin(e_psi[t])*dt;`

`e_psi[t+1] = e_psi[t] + v[t]/Lf * delta[t] * dt`

The horizon for the MPC optimization is the product of the number of simulation steps `N` and simulation discritization `dt`. In the course lectures, 25 simulation steps were used with a discritization of 50ms. In my project, I experimented with several different values, but settled on 25 steps with a discritization of 100ms. This extended my horizon and gave me good results.

The simulation provided relevant trajectory waypoints for the vehicles's current location, however, both the trajectory waypoints and the vehicle's location and heading were given in the global reference frame. To simplify the MPC calculations, I converted both the waypoints and the vehicle's location to the vehicle coordinate frame. This was acheived by translating, then rotating the points in the global coordinate frame using the vehicle's current location and heading. Then, the trajectory points were fit to a 3rd order polynomial, whose coefficents were fed to the MPC. 

The final challenge was to account for the 100ms control latency. To do this, I projected the current state of the vehicle forward by the latency time using the current actuator values, then used that as the initial state for the MPC. Thus, the optimal action computed by the MPC would be the optimal action at the time that the controls take effect.

* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/) or the [Github releases](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases) page.
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
